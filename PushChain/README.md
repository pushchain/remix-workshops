## Push Chain

Push Chain is the first True Universal Layer 1 blockchain, built as a 100% EVM-compatible Proof of Stake (PoS) chain. It runs seamlessly across every chain and wallet.

Write your smart contract once, deploy it on Push Chain, and instantly reach users on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Solana, and all other supported chains without changing on-chain code.
